You should use [plan](../../opensnipping/plan.md) and [spec](../../opensnipping/spec.md) to guide your work.

- atomically work on one task at a time, test it (add unit tests where applicable) or ask human user to test it visually
- update spec or plan if needed
- always ask for commit or push, and only do it after approval
