description: improve copilot and agent instructions in this repo

Improve the instructions for copilot and agents. Keep instructions concise and clear.

When adding guidelines, deduplicate across these files (use reference links in markdown) unless context-specific repetition is valuable:

All instructions are in `.github/`:
- Repo-wide: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- Agent actions: `.github/agents/engineer.agent.md`
- Prompts: `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md`
