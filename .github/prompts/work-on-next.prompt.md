description: work on the next atomic task from the plan
---

Using [plan](../../opensnipping/plan.md), identify the next atomic task. The task should be logically cohesive and verifiable by test or manual check. Before starting:

1. Review 2-4 upcoming atomic tasks for safe parallelization
2. If any can run in parallel, provide a ready-to-copy prompt for a separate agent (with context and clear spec)

Then proceed with the selected task:

1. Implement
2. Compile
3. Test
4. Commit per [Commit and Push Policy](../copilot-instructions.md#commit-and-push-policy)
