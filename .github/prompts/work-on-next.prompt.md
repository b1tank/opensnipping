description: work on the next atomic task in the plan
---

Using the [plan](../../opensnipping/plan.md) as guidance, identify the next atomic task to work on. Ensure that the task is logically cohesive and can be verified by a simple test or manual check. Before starting, always check the next 2-4 atomic tasks for safe parallelization. If any can be done in parallel, provide a ready-to-copy prompt for a separate agent that includes the necessary context and a clear task spec. Then proceed to implement the selected task following the established work principles and categories.

- implement
- compile
- test
- commit based on commit and push policies
